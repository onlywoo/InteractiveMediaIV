    <h1>Internet art Preparation</h1>
<p>I would like to create something similar to r/place on Reddit however I&rsquo;m aware that this is a big scope and might be beyond what I can do but I want to utilise the tic-tac-toe tutorial on react and use something similar for people to create art like that. The idea is to use a money system where if a person adds more money they can have more space to draw in and therefore have a more noticeable art piece.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking inspiration from one of the previous student works provided, Khutso Nkadimeng (<a href="https://nkadimengk.github.io/north-south/">https://nkadimengk.github.io/WSOA4175A_884200/<span>Links to an external site.</span></a>), and the money aspect comes from there. The art creation comes from r/place and the game tic-tac-toe in the React tutorial (<a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe">Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe &ndash; React</a>).</p>
<p>The money system will take some time to figure out as well as if I decide to carry on with this internet art, I would like to make It more like r/place than it just being o and x&rsquo;s to draw with. My concerns are that I would be able to facilitate the money system, I feel I might struggle to make it so people need over a certain amount of money to buy a piece and how that will unlock blocks to draw in as well as deducting the money after using the spaces.</p>
