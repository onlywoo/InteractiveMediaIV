    <h1>Critical Reflection on UI and UX</h1><p>User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are two important aspects of designing digital products. While UI refers to a digital product's visual and interactive elements, UX encompasses the entire user journey and their overall experience with the product (Nasution and Nusa, 2021).</p>
    <p>UI and UX are essential components of digital product design. A good UI should be intuitive and visually appealing, while a good UX should be designed with the user's needs and expectations in mind. Both UI and UX require ongoing research, testing, and adaptation to keep up with changing user needs and technological advancements (Nasution and Nusa, 2021).</p>
    <p>My website is very simple looking as I want it to have the aesthetic of an art gallery where they're often straightforward. This is because the internet art I want to create where it is similar to r/place on Reddit where users can create art pieces but I would like to make it so users can buy a certain amount of pixels or blocks to draw inside of to make pixel art, the more money you have the bigger your art is and more likely to be noticed. This is a commentary on how it's easier to pursue arts if you are privileged enough to have money and status.</p>
    <p>In &ldquo;<em>Art work or money: Conflicts in the Construction of a creative identity&rdquo; </em>they speak about the economic factors that impact the way newer artists create art (Taylor and Littleton, 2008). I would like to investigate this and go deeper into interpreting this into internet art.</p>

    <p><a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/"></a></p>
    <p>Due to my wanting my website to look clean and sleek, I used a simple navigation that has all the information available at once and very clear headings as to what page you are on. I decided on this colour scheme because as much I would like the simplistic clean aesthetic I do not like pure white websites and decided to go with warmer tones to make it easier to look at. All the pages follow the same colour and look.</p>
    <p>The blogs have a dark background to make them easier to read and the reason this colour was chosen is that, in many of the art galleries I&rsquo;ve searched, they are often fully white with some bold colours. I also added in a line space of 1.6 because I struggle reading new times roman however if it is spaced better it becomes much easier to read especially long walls of text.</p>
    <p>The reasoning for the UI and UX used is that it is one place through out the website and is easy to navigate. Users are able to navigate wherever they want from wherever they want. The user is also aware of where they are at all times because of the headings and the ability to see all possible links at all times. The UI is incredibly simple because of its aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>
