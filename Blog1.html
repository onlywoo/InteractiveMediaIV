        >The revision videos are long however I appreciate them a lot because I
        need to be able to go back and forward to fully grasp what I am
        learning. I really like them because they strengthen my foundation it
        wasn&rsquo;t strong at first and taught me things&nbsp; I know I would
        have appreciated last year. I&nbsp; am furthering my skills to be able
        to learn what I need to make the websites of my dreams.</span

      <span
        >Web art is an incredibly interesting thing, it&rsquo;s interesting what
        can be done as well as showing that people will find a way to create no
        matter the medium. It&rsquo;s very comforting in a way that art will and
        can be found anywhere and there will be people trying to send a message
        or have their creativity sparked in different ways.</span

      <span>My favourite out of all the internet art is </span
      ><i><span>Exhausting a Crowd</span></i
      ><span
        >. It&rsquo;s a commission by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
        in the exhibition </span
      ><i><span>&nbsp;All of this Belongs to You</span></i
      ><span
        >. This piece takes in the public eye and how there is no privacy as the
        tagline is &ldquo;click &amp; follow everyone&rdquo;. The draw-in of the
        whole exhibition is that you can people watch, you see glimpses into
        people's lives, incidents that are never recorded. Existing just </span
      ><i><span>happens</span></i
      ><span>.&nbsp; (Meier, 2015).</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        These the reasons I like this piece because it showcases untold stories
        while also opening our eyes to everyday lives and no privacy. This seems
        like a nightmare for people with anxiety though as people are afraid of
        being seen and knowing you&rsquo;re always being watched is a heavy
        feeling. This point stands to me specifically because the advice often
        given is that you should not worry as no one cares and is living their
        own life.&nbsp; A spin on this is that this piece shows no one does care
        and even if they do see you nothing happens.</span>
