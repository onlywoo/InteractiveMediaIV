      In the essay &ldquo;Convention and Context&rdquo;, Steven Mailloux
      examines the relationship between them in literature. He argues that
      convention and context are shaped by external things like culture and
      evolution. In the same way, literature is changed and shaped by the
      cultural and historical contexts in which they are read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature allows for interpretation, &ldquo;reading between the
      lines&rdquo; where readers don&rsquo;t have to be explicitly told. An
      example to understand better is poems and sonnets, while they do not say
      the exact words, the reader can use interpretation, and context clues to
      understand the deeper meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does, however, argue that literary conventions are not able to be
      neutral or objective in terms of interpretation because there is a much
      larger cultural and historical force that dictates that. For example,
      tragedy and comedy themes are decided by how we view bad and good things
      in the human experience and world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mailloux makes the argument that when creating, literary interpretation
      must take into account the conventions and cultural and historical
      contexts. He argues that literature can be seen as &ldquo;historical
      artefacts&rdquo; that mirror the cultural context of the time it was
      created, the interpretation takes into consideration the cultural context
      of the author and reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mailloux&rsquo;s essay emphasises the importance of understanding the
      literary conventions and historical, and cultural context constructed so
      that there is a suggestion as to how to interpret the piece.
