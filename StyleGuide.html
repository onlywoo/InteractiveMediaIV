    <p>I made my website according to this colour scheme because it is simple and follows the aesthetic of the Art Gallery I am trying to achieve and because I don&rsquo;t want to use pure white I decided to go with a warmer scheme so it isn&rsquo;t hard on the eyes and can make the website look more aesthetically pleasing.
        
    <p><img src="Images/Colourscheme.png" width="200" alt=" src="Colourscheme of brown and beige as well as one deep navy blue from coolors"></p>
    <p>I decided to use New times Roman as it is a classic font that is often associated with professionalism.</p>
    <p>I went with the simple UI and UX because after looking at a few websites that were in line with the aesthetic that I wanted they all had a very simple and I thought using this sticky navigation was a good idea to showcase the simplicity and clean look I wanted.</p>
    <p>To make the website more art gallery-like, I would like to add decorations such as boarders or underlines to the words that look like the boarders of a picture frame and have the captions to things that look like that of a label that goes under paintings in galleries.</p>
